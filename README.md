# Election_Analysis

### Projec Overview

This project that was assigned from the Colorado Board of Elections employees who wanted to know the results and the election audit of a recently held local elections. 

The goals for this analysis is followed:

* Determining the total number of votes cast in the Election 
* Designing and creating a complete list of all candidates that receieved votes during the Election. 
* Design code that determines the total percentage of votes receieved for each candidate during the election.
* Designing code that determines the total votes received for each canidate during the Election
* Expanding upon previous code and determine the winner of the Congressional Election


### Resources 

The resources used was: election_results.csv


### Election Audit Results

* The election had a total of 369,711 voters that came out to vote in the counties that were analyzed. 
* Jefferson County, Denver County and Aprapahoe County were the counties that were analyzed. Jefferson recieved 10.5% of the vote having a total of 38,855 votes; Denver county had received 82.8% totalling at 306,055 votes and Arapahoe county receiving 6.7% totalling 24,801 votes. 
* The candidates that received votes were: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane. Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote, totalling 85,213 votes: Diana Degette received 73.8% of the vote, totalling 272,892 votes; Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes making a total of 11,606 votes. With the data given Diana is the winner of the election. 
* Overall, the data tells that the winner of the election was Diana DeGetter who received 73.8% of the vote, the most in Dencer county. 

### Summary


In summary, the code provided can be formatted and reused for other election data srts for other elections around the county. With such a maleable code with declarations and comments, this code can edited for future elections with little hassle making it not only reliable but also highly efficient and useful. The process of creating code within Python for this project was long and tedious. Many hands were thrown up in exhaustion and many headaches were experienced. However, the following code allows one to analyze large amounts of election data in a concise and collected manner to quickly return an easy-to-understand summary of results. For an Election Commission responsible for delivering final vote results, not only do answers need to be delivered quickly - they need to be delivered fast. Not only does the following code for this Election Analysis do just that, but this code can be modified for other elections as well which would be of great use to an Election Commission.
